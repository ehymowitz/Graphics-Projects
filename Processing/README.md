# Processing Projects

Mini projects made using Processing and the hAPI_Fisica engine - Haptic and non-Haptic simulations (Non-haptics are slightly less sophisticated).

Surface Tension - Move the mouse to create balls with surface tension - move around the Haplet to interact with them.

BallRings - Creates a ball rings which move in an aesthetic way. Move the Haplet to change parameters.

lib contains EmptyHapticWorld and is the base template for haplet projects. The code folder contains hAPI_Fisica files
